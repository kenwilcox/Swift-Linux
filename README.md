# Swift-Linux
Playing with Swift on Linux

## Download
I installed swift from here
https://swift.org/download/ - I used Swift version 3.0 (swift-3.0-PREVIEW-2)

Followed the instructions to get it working on Linux
Done

## Build
cd to the Hello directory (Sources should be in that directory)
```
$ swift build
$ .build/debug/Hello [name]

Nothing too impressive or difficult.
